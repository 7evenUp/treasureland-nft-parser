# Hey Crypto World!

### This is a repo for watching NFT prices from TreasureLand

### I've alredy built for all PancakeSwap's NFTs

**main.py** file fetches prices from TreasureLand. For all NFTs it takes about 1700sec on my PC. I think it's possible to make it faster with asyncronous features, but I'm not good at python

**show.py** file print beautiful table of history on prices in terminal

Will be glad to see some support to make this repo more professional tool to see price changes on TreasureLand
